# Final Release Notes

## Improved README

Due to time constraints, the README included in the beta release was missing significant amounts of information related to the nature of the feedback. The current version is more complete, containing detailed instructions and descriptions along with multiple screenshots.

## Fixed Presentation Index Bug

When assigning multiple feedback forms to a presentation, the application would previously create a table in the presentations index page that overflowed to the right of the window. This is now fixed, and all presenters and attached feedback forms are listed and viewable.

## Added Instruction to New Presentation Form

Added a label for the presenter selection box. This label instructs the user to hold command/control while selecting users to select multiple.

## Implemented Functionality for Visibility and Anonymity Settings

Response values will now be hidden for any users who don't meet the configured criteria for visibility, and respondent identities will be obscured for any users who don't meet the configured criteria for deaononymization (the responses are also shuffled, so that people can't identify respondents by order).
